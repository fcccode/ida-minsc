Welcome to IDA-Minsc
====================

IDA-minsc is a plugin for IDA Pro that assists a user with scripting the
IDAPython plugin that is bundled with the disassembler. This plugin groups the
different aspects of the IDAPython API into a simpler format which allows a
reverse engineer to script different aspects of their work with very little
investment.

A number of concepts are introduced such as a tagging system, support for
multicased functions, and filtering with the intention that most search
and annotation issues can be performed with just a few lines of code. This
should enable a user to write quick, hacky, throwaway code that can be used
to augment their reversing endeavors.
