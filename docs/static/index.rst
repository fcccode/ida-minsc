Welcome to IDA-Minsc
====================

IDA-Minsc is a plugin that groups the different aspects of IDAPython's
API into a more manageable and intuitive format which allows a
reverse-engineer to script different aspects of their work without too
much investment. Combined with a tagging system for marking specific parts
of the databases and quickly retrieving them, most search and annotation
needs can be performed in just a couple lines of code. The hope is that
by simplifying the interaction with IDAPython's API, scripting is more
of an implicit task as opposed to explicit development work that the
reverse-engineer has to context switch into in order to perform.
